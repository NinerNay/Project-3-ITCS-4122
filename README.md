## The Hidden Cost of Flight Delays
Flight delays are more than an inconvenience, they shape passenger satisfaction, airline reputation, and overall efficiency of the aviation system. With millions of people relying on air travel every day, even small disruptions can cause missed connections, more delays, and significant operational and economic costs.

Air travel remains the safest and fastest way to get around the world, and with millions of people depending on it daily, there is little room for error. Many people utilize air travel in many different ways whether it's for a business trip, vacation, visiting loved ones, and many more reasons.

Using a 10-year dataset of airline delays, we explore:

* Which airlines and airports face the most challenges?
* What factors contribute most to those delays?
* How do delays compare with more severe disruptions like cancellations or diversions?
  
By uncovering these patterns, we aim to shed light on the operational challenges airlines face and the broader implications for passengers and the aviation system as a whole.
